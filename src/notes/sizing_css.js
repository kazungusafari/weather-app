/* 
 
Some boxes have own size  e.g image

Their size is determined by themselves

Give them border to see the extend of their intrisic size

Some boxes do not have their own size e.g empty div

if give border to an empty div,you will just see a line on a page(collapsed border) that stretches
to the width of the container

If you add content,the height of this div will be defined by the content

Size come from the content
Size come itself

What if we give our div a specific size ? (extrinsic size)

It can cause overflow

Box does not have enough space to fill all the content

Relative and fixed size



Units to use to size box
 ->> percentages of container


 Sizing boxes
  width,height,padding,border

 What units to use for width,height,padding and border ?

 Giving our boxes fixed sizes?

 Giving our boxes minimum and maximum sizes
 
 Box with variable content,but must have a minimum height and width

 images

 Scale a box down inside a box with extrinsic size 
 if there is not enough space to display them at their intrinsic size

 Variable content and overflow 

 A box is forced to stretch and fill container ? Is it a good idea
