    mm                       Milimeters                    1mm=1/10th of 1cm
    Q                        Quarter-milimeters            1Q=1/40th of 1cm

    Relative Lengths Units

    They are relative to something 
      -> size of parent
      -> size of viewport
      -> size of root
   Size scale relative to something else on the page

   Unit                   Relative to
   em                     parent  
   ex                    
   ch
   rem                    root
   lh
   vw                     1% of viewport width
   vh                     1% of viewport height
   vmin                   1% of viewport's smaller dimension
   vmax                   1% of viewport's larger dimension


   Setting width of box
    px
    em
    rem

    keywords
    
    color keyword e.g red

    Hexadecimal codes
    -> hash/pound symbol followed by six hexadecimal numbers which take one of 16 values between 0 and f
       0123456789abcde

    RGB and RGBA values

    They are functions 
     rgb(red,green,blue)
     rgba(red,green,blue,alpha)
     hsl(hue,saturation,lightness)
     hsla(hue,saturation,lightness,alpha)
