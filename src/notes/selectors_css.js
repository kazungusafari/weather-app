  Telling Which HTML elements should be selected ?
  What css rule(s) should be applied to them?

  Same CSS for individual selectors -> selector list

  When you group selectors,if any selector is invalid the whole rule

  Style an HTML element e.g a {}
  Style an HTML element with given class  e.g .link {}
  Style an HTML element with given id e.g #footer
  Style an HTML element with given attribute  e.g a[title]
  Style an HTML element with given attribute with a particular value e.g a[href="www.example.com"]
  Style certain state of an HTML element e.g a:hover
  Style a certain part of an element rather than the element itself e.g p::first-letter
  Select an HTML based on relationship using combinators
   -> Descendant  e.g  .main p
   -> Immediate Children  div > p
   -> Adjacent sibling p + span
   -> General sibling p ~ spam
