  Screen sizes

  Unwanted scrollbars

  Overly long line length

  Poor use of space

  A set of practices that allows web pages to alter their layout and appearance to suit different 
  screen sizes widths,resolutions,etc.

  Responsive Design
  
   -> Fluid grids
   -> Fluid images
   -> Media query

   Media Query
   -> Screen Types
   -> Width of the viewpoint

   Breakpoints 
    -> point where a media query is introduced and the layout changed.

 Mobile first Approach 

 -> Single-column layout for narrow-screen devices e.g mobile phones 

 -> check for larger screens and implement a multiple-column layout when you know that you
   have enough screen width to handle it.

 Change layout between breakpoints
 Layout built on top of flexible grids
 With flexible grids,you only add in a breakpoint and change the design at the point where content
 starts to look bad.
