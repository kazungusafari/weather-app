Usage 
  
  Newspaper layout
  
  Floating images inside blocks of text.
  
  This block may wrap around the left or right of the image.

  What else can you float?

  Drop caps

  Multiple columns of information floated so they sit along one another.

  Take a box out of normal flow and stuck either to left or right-hand side of its parent container
  
  Then any content that comes below the floated box in the normal
  wrap around the floated box,filling up the space to the right or left handside of the floated box as fa
  
  You can only add a margin to the floated box to push the text,but you cannot add margin
  to the text to push it away from the floated box.

  A float is removed from normal flow and that other elements will display beside it.

  If we do not want other elements to display beside the float,we clear it.

  You can clear items floated to the left,right or both right and left.

  A tall float and short element beside it? Clearing won't work
